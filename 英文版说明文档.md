# Personal Resume System

## System Purpose

The Personal Resume System aims to help job seekers create, manage, and optimize professional resumes. The system adopts a modular design, utilizing structured processes and professional optimization suggestions to enable users to create authentic, specific, professional, and competitive personal resumes.

This system does not rely on a frontend interface or database, but instead uses a series of markdown documents and standardized processes to help users complete the entire process from information collection to resume optimization.
